# Latin Dictionary

## Why a Latin Dictionary?
This project is a confluence of my two passions, Natural Language Processing and Latin. When reading in Latin, which is a highly inflected language, I often encounter
unfamiliar verbs and nouns, and knowing tense, gender, and case is vital to the understanding of the text. I would often use tools such as Whitaker's Words and Wiktionary, but when I travel or have a poor Internet connection, a dictionary running on my local computer would be so much more convenient. So, I decided to create my own (for now, a command-line) dictionary, which would combine the functionality of the two dictionaries I mentioned.
